# UNIT-Projects

**Get Next Line** - A C function that reads any valid file line by line until the end.
 There are so many easier methods of doing this by using standard C functions. 
 But the goal here is to be able to do it by using any functions from my libft and only 
 the standard functions read, malloc and free.

**Lem-in** - is a game about ant farm. Need to find the shortest path from start room to the end.
The goal of the project is to understand the graphs. I implemented the algorithm BFS.

**Filler** - The goal of this project is to code an AI for the game of Filler, for which we have a virtual machine.

**Libft** - My implementation of some of the Standard C Library functions including some additional ones.

**AlCu** - Custom little game + AI

**Ft_printf** - is a project that aims to mimic the printf function (#include <stdio.h>).

**Fdf** - A simple 3D height-map renderer. You can rotate models, color is defined by relative height in the map.

**Piscine PHP** - Learn PHP in 2 intensive weeks !

**Fillit** - This is the story of a piece of Tetris, one little square and a dev walk into a bar... 
Fillit is not about recoding Tetris, even if itâ€™s still a variant of this game. 
This program will take a file as parameter, which contains a list of Tetriminos,
and arrange them in order to create the smallest square possible.
